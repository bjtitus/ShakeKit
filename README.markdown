What is ShakeKit?
-------------------------

ShakeKit is an Objective-C wrapper for the super awesome [mlkshk.com](http://mlkshk.com).  With it you can (hopefully) create awesome Mac and iOS applications that take advantage of the service.

As of 05/28/2011 it wraps every method available from mlkshk's [developer API page](http://mlkshk.com/developers).  That should allow you to do the following

* Upload a new image to your shake
* Get your shake timeline
* Get user profile info
* Get your shake timeline before or after a certain file
